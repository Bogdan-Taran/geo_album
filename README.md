# geo_album

A mobile application for viewing photos on a map (made for **Volga-IT**).

The app acts as a smart gallery that lets you switch to an interactive map and see **where your photos were taken** ‚Äî as long as they contain **geotagged EXIF data**.

## üì∏ Features

- üó∫Ô∏è Display geotagged photos on an interactive map (powered by [Flutter Map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map))
- üñºÔ∏è Browse images in a clean, scrollable gallery view
- üìç Tap any photo on the map to view it in full screen
- üìÇ Local asset-based image loading (manual setup required)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Add Your Own Photos

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The app currently **does not access your device‚Äôs photo gallery**. All images must be added manually as assets.

### Step 1: Add images to the assets folder
Place your geotagged images (JPEG/PNG) into:
assets/Pictures/


### Step 2: Register image paths
Open `lib/image_exif_service.dart` and update the `imagePaths` list:

```dart
static const List<String> imagePaths = [
  'assets/Pictures/image1.jpg',
  'assets/Pictures/image2.jpg',
  'assets/Pictures/vacation_photo.png',
  // Add more paths here
];
```

Tip: Only images with valid GPS EXIF metadata will appear on the map. 
Use tools like ExifTool to verify or edit geotags. 

### Tech Stack
Framework: Flutter
Map: flutter_map + OpenStreetMap tiles
EXIF Parsing: Custom parser using dart:typed_data (extracts GPS coordinates from image bytes)
State Management: Provider


### Known Limitations
‚ùå No access to device photo library (manual asset loading only)
‚ùå Only static image list (no dynamic file scanning)
‚ùå PNG support for EXIF is limited (JPEG recommended)
‚ùå No offline map caching
